### Overview:
Music is an amazing thing, humans are privileged with. Many a times it gives us a purpose to keep moving. Music is embedded in every phase of our life, be it a happy time, or lost in memories, music brings life in our lives.
There are many music companies, which offers easier and convenient way to listen music, whenever and wherever we want. For the companies to operate, they need to get some revenue and for which they charge some subscription fee to users. Different companies offerers different plans to audience that suits to individuals, well they try to. But, users having multiple options, with one being better than the other or more personalized to an individual, users often change the subscription plans. Music companies, don’t like their user base to move away, and it we can predict which user is likely to churn, company can push offers and more personalized plan to a user to prevent from churning. n this project, we are provided with user log data of the Sparkify. The data consists of demographic info, user activities, and timestamps etc. The task is to analyze the data to predict the customers’ likely to churn, and thus send them the offers to prevent them from churning.
The model performance is assessed using F1 score to find a balance on both precision and recall, so that we wouldn’t miss too many customers who are likely to churn whilst we don’t want to waste too much on those who are not likely to churn.
